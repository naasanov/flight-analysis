### The Competition
This project was created in 24 hours for the [Carolina Data Challenge](https://cdc.cs.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill.
Contestents were provided with a dataset to work with and tasked with developing a data science related project in teams of up to four peers.
### The Project
Developed by Nicolas Asanov and Megan Taylor, this project focuses on the "US Airline Flight Routes and Fares 1993-2024" dataset. 
The dataset includes information on airline routes between origin and destination cities, detailing passenger volume, fare prices, market share, year, and quarter.
### The Objective
The goal of this project was to identify cities that showed significant change in passenger volume and average fare per mile across quarters, specifically in the year 2023.
This tool is intended for consumers looking to make informed travel decisions â€” allowing them to choose the best times and destinations for cost-effective fares while avoiding high-traffic periods.
